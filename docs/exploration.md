## Notes on Playing
- It's instrument building. You set up interesting timbral content and effects. If it doesn't work you can switch to a new Lane.

- Write the melody/timing of a loop with seeker. Write the timbre with Eurorack.

## Notes on Writing
- Simple motif on Lane 1. A chord with an extension. Maybe some transforms. Creates the mood
- Pulsar on Lane 2. Simple rhythmic pattern
